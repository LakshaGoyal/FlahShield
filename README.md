# FraudShield 🔒

FraudShield is an **AI-powered fraud detection and prevention system** designed to analyze transactions, reviews, and user behavior patterns to detect fraudulent or suspicious activity.

This project is being developed as part of the **Akash Network track** and will be fully open source.

---

## 🚀 Vision
Fraud Shield aims to provide:
- **Fraudulent review detection** on e-commerce platforms
- **Anomaly detection** for financial transactions
- **API-based integration** for apps and businesses
- **Deployment on decentralized cloud** (Akash Network)

---

## 📌 Planned Features
- Real-time monitoring and alerts  
- Machine Learning models for fraud detection  
- Lightweight API service (FastAPI/Flask)  
- Containerized deployment with Docker  
- Scalable hosting on **Akash Network**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (planned)
- **Python** (FastAPI / Flask) – backend  
- **Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch** – ML models  
- **Docker** – containerization  
- **Akash Network** – decentralized hosting  

---

## 📅 Roadmap
**Phase 1**: Project setup & open-source repo ✅  
**Phase 2**: Develop fraud detection ML models  
**Phase 3**: Build API & integrate with front-end  
**Phase 4**: Containerize with Docker  
**Phase 5**: Deploy on Akash Network
